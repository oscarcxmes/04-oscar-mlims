	<h2>Know more about Us</h2>

<section>
	<h3 id="ourhistoryh3">Our history</h3>

	<p>It all started in 2017, when a group of classmates who were studying web programming decided to do a project about a fictitious music festival. At the end of the course, they saw that they could materialize this project in reality.</p>

	<p>They began to move to find out about the permits that needed to be obtained, the laws that had to be complied with... They also had to get the contacts of the artists, it was a lot of work, but after a few years of work they managed to create a complete planning of the entire RSF tour.</p>

	<p>Now we carry out and we assume that this is already real, so now we have to work on perfecting the project as much as possible to make you enjoy music like you have never done before!</p>

	<h3 id="whoweareh3">Who we are</h3>

	<p>Perhaps you will be surprised if we tell you that the base of the project has been created and supported by 4 people, yes, 4 people. More than 4 people, we are 4 friends, 4 lifelong friends who are now fulfilling what they wanted so much.</p>

	<p>But the RSF is not just us, the RSF is a team of hundreds of workers who build and prepare the stages, who help you through the screen, who clean the venue, who work at the bar. Each and every one of us forms the RSF together with you.</p>

	<p>We all share the same values, those that make us form an impeccable team and make everything go perfectly.</p>

<h3 id="ourvaluesh3">Our values</h3>

<p>From the RSF we make a difference with 3 fundamental values:</p>


<dl>
	<dt>Equality</dt>
	<dd>Within the RSF we strive to promote diversity and inclusion, promoting gender equality as one of the main values. In all our events we carry out cultural activities to raise awareness of gender equality.</dd>

	<dt>Sustainability</dt>
	<dd>From the organization, we focus our actions on reducing and recycling most of the material and waste produced at the festival, since an event of these characteristics generates a large volume of waste. In this way we collaborate with the preservation of natural resources and reduction of pollution.</dd>

	<dt>Awareness</dt>
	<dd>Our audience is a very young audience, so it is our obligation to make each and every one of you aware of the responsibility of alcohol. We inform and raise awareness about the harmful effects of excessive alcohol consumption, offering guidelines for responsible consumption.</dd>
