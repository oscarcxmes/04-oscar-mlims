	<section>
		<p>In each edition of our festival you will have plenty of activities to enjoy, from
		 huge pools to hookah areas. Here is a very very little list of things that you can do! 
		(appart from leave it all on the dance floor).</p>

		
			<h3>Refreshing pools</h3>
				<blockquote><p>We have taken care that there is no location where the festival is going to be 
				held that does not have a pool. Yes indeed! nothing about drinks and foot inside the
				pool enclousure.</p></blockquote>

			<h3>Food trucks</h3>
				<blockquote><p>You will find food trucks around the chill area enclousure. You will be able to buy all kinds 
				of food to keep your energy up to the maximum throughout the event.</p></blockquote>

			<h3>Shisha area</h3>
				<blockquote><p>The most acclaimed area of the chill zone! Sometimes the heat hits hard, or you just prefer to
				relax a bit in some armchairs with hookahs and friends, that is your relax time.</p></blockquote>

			<h3>Water attractions</h3>
				<blockquote><p>There will be water attractions to keep you refreshed and to enjoy them with the rest of the people, including 
				one of the biggest portable attractions of the country.</p></blockquote>

			<h3>More surprises</h3>
				<blockquote><p>We have an infinity of surprises prepared for you throughout the festival that will leave you speechless! 
				If we told you everything now it wouldn't be funny, come and see for yourself.</p></blockquote>
